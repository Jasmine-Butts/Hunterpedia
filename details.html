        <p id="background-info">Born in the Republic of Padokea, Killua is the middle child of the Zoldyck assassin family. Trained from birth by Silva, Kikyo, and Illumi, he mastered numerous killing techniques at a young age and began life-threatening tailing training at age three.
            <br>
            Early on, he fulfilled three of Alluka's requests, triggering Nanika. He learned about its powers and kept it secret from his parents until Mitsuba informed them after witnessing an episode. When questioned, he explained Nanika's abilities, including that refusing four demands caused death after Mitsuba's killing.
            <br>
            At six, Silva forced him to compete in Heavens Arena's martial arts tournament until reaching the 200th floor. He reached the 150th floor in two months and the 200th in two years total.
            <br>
            Between ages six and nine, he mastered darts and tried befriending the newly hired Canary, who declined due to their different social status.
            <br>
            His family eventually decided he lacked a true assassin's mindset and had Illumi implant a needle in his head to instill fear and prevent him from freeing Alluka.
            <br>
            Three years before the Yorknew City arc, his father summoned him and his brothers after assassinating Phantom Troupe member #8, warning them to avoid the Troupe.
            <br>
            At 11, tired of killing, he rebelled by injuring his mother and older brother, then ran away to take the Hunter Exam for fun. By then, he'd already killed more people than the Bomber(s) combined.</p>
